# AutoBoy

AutoBoy is the pre-launch order book for Bankr launches on Base.

<https://thefirm.biz/autoboy>

## Capabilities

### Want to buy tokens at launch ?

1. Place buy orders for a project's future Bankr token before it launches.
2. Define order parameters: how much to spend & max mcap to buy at.
3. _AutoBoy auto-buys the token within moments of launch._

### Want to launch a Bankr token?

AutoBoy is the missing link in your Bankr TGE toolkit:

1. **Amplification & distribution** – AutoBoy maximises your Bankr TGE volume & distribution:
   it features top projects in-app with direct notifications to high-signal users
   active in early Base launches, and turns your committed buyers into a
   distribution channel – each gets custom, shareable assets and an incentive to
   post them, so your launch reaches their followers before and after TGE.

2. **Monitor & build demand** – Your community commits buy orders before TGE,
   so your token launches with a real order book instead of hoping people show up. AutoBoy's
   dashboard shows who will buy, how much, and at what price, plus simulates your launch market cap based on AutoBoy's order book.

3. **Quality holders & launch control** – AutoBoy's closed beta is an allowlist
   of high-signal users – the holders you want early. Allowlist specific buyers
   to control who gets in, and vest their tokens.

### API Base URL

```
https://thefirm.biz/api/public/v1
```

### API Reference

Every endpoint's auth, request, responses, and behavior is documented in the API reference docs -

- **Interactive UI** (for humans) → [`docs.thefirm.biz/api-reference`](https://docs.thefirm.biz/api-reference)
- **OpenApi JSON Schema** (for agents) → [`thefirm.biz/api/public/v1/openapi.json`](http://thefirm.biz/api/public/v1/openapi.json)

### Get an API key

Most endpoints require an API key. Keys aren't self-serve — Jeffrey (Computer Operator) reviews each request and you'll hear back via the contact you provide.

#### **Buying tokens:**

Request a key directly: [**API Reference: Request an API key**](https://docs.thefirm.biz/api-reference/api-keys/request-an-api-key)

```text
POST https://thefirm.biz/api/public/v1/api-key-requests
```

#### **Launching a token:**

Register your project - (approval comes with your API key): [**API Reference: Register a project**](https://docs.thefirm.biz/api-reference/projects/register-a-project)

```text
POST https://thefirm.biz/api/public/v1/projects
```

### Authenticate requests

Send your key as a bearer token on every authenticated request:

```text
Authorization: Bearer autoboy_…
```

### Verify your key

List projects to confirm your key works:

```bash
curl https://thefirm.biz/api/public/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer autoboy_…"
```

A `200` with a JSON list of projects means you're set up.

### Conventions across every endpoint

- **USDC amounts** in request and response fields are decimal strings (`"50"`,
  `"203.32"`). **Token balances and withdrawal amounts** are atomic-unit
  base-10 strings — USDC has 6 decimals, so `"2500000"` means 2.5 USDC.
- **Pagination** is cursor-based: omit `cursor` for the first page, then pass
  `meta.nextCursor` verbatim. `limit` defaults to 20, clamped 1–100. A null
  `nextCursor` means the last page.
- **Errors** return `{ "error": "<label>", "message": "<detail>" }`
